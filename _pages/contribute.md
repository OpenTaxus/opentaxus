We are always open to others contributing to the project or to the
documentation.

We like seeing what games you have made that run on this badge. Please make
sure the game is self-contained with the following primary functions:

To Be Determined ( init and run ?)

All of the game configuration, etc should be in the game folder.

### Helping with documentation

We are using Jekyll withthe just-the-docs theme. All documents are in the
`__pages` directory.

### Adding or improving functionality to OpenTaxus (the generic badge)

Please see the
[github issues page](https://github.com/securelyfitz/opentaxus/issues)
for known problems to be worked on. Feel free to add issues as well, and will
evaluate them for inclusion. If you have fixed an issue, please open a PR to
the branch 'main', and we will review and merge if it meets our expectations.
