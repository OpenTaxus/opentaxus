Welcome to OpenTaxus, an open source hardware conference badge.

The goal of this project is to allow conferences to quickely and easily
create hardware and software to have a badge which encourages conference
participants to engage with each other. Ideally this will inspire
conversations that might not have occurred otherwise.

This documentation is to enable creation of a badge from a generic template,
creating a customized badge for a conference (more than just graphical changes),
or contributing to this project.
